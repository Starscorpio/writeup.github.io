### Enumeration (Information Gathering):
Starting off with an nmap scan to check which ports are open:
1. 21 - ftp
2. 22 - ssh
3. 139, 445 - smb (netbios)

After doing a full port scan using:
`nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/lamefull 10.10.10.3 --max-retries 0`, we get:

Ports open after full port scan:
1. 21 - ftp
2. 22 - ssh
3. 139, 445 - smb

As we can see that port 21/ftp is open, we can try and connect to it via ftp:
`ftp 10.10.10.3`

Port 3432 distccd has a remote command execution.
There is an nmap script avaiable for this and you can find it here:
[port 3432 rce nmap script](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.html)
