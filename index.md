### Enumeration (Information Gathering):
Starting off with an nmap scan to check which ports are open:
1. 21/ftp
2. 22/ssh
3. 139, 445/smb (netbios)

After doing a full port scan using `nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/lamefull 10.10.10.3 --max-retries 0`, we get:

Ports open after full port scan:
1. 21/ftp
2. 22/ssh)
3. 139,445/smb, 139 - (netbios - netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)) 139 - (netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
4. 3632 distccd distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))

As we can see that port 21/ftp is open, we can try to connect via ftp:
`ftp 10.10.10.3`
