## Welcome to GitHub Pages
This is my first blog and I'm using github pages for the first time, so wish me luck.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Starscorpio/writeup.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Now, check for suids which have there suid bit enabled, by running the LinEnum.sh script:-


 


-As we can see that the suid bit is enabled for nmap binary/tool.

Using nmap in interactive mode to get root:
-nmap --interactive
---Then enter:
!sh

--And we are ROOT!!!!


**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Starscorpio/writeup.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
